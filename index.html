            This little demo was written in AngularJS. It is supposed to simulate a file (image/video) uploader which a user can select a 
            file from their computer and upload it to the "add content" page. I wanted to create an "add content" page which was supposed to
            allow the user to upload a file, give it a description, add tags to the associated file, ability to remove tags by passing in "eraseable=true" to the tag component, and select "Add". Selecting add would
            have shown the file in the main page with the tags that the user added. Due to time constraints (was only able to work on this for 3 hours during
            the weekend), I only demonstrated that I can utilize the routing capabilities given by AngularJS.<br>
            <br>
            On the main page, a user can search for files based on these tags. These tags are not eraseable as I'm passing "eraseable=false" through the search view. If a user uploaded a file with tags such as "arm", "surgery",
            "removal", another user would be able to search for any, some or all of those 3 tags and find this video.<br>
            <br>
            If I had more time, I would have hooked this up to a MySQL database with several tables such as Files (ID, Name, Description, Type, ServerPath)
            and Tags (ID, FileID, Name). I would have also implemented pagination. In terms of the searching, I would have implemented a timer of 1 second
            for every keypress event. Whenever a keypress happens, it would reset the timer back to 1 second. This would prevent us spamming the database with
            a bunch of calls every time that a user presses a key.<br>
            <br>     
            The reason for this demo was so that I could show that I can quickly pick up languages and frameworks. The file structure of this 
            code isn't the best... I started refactoring the code and restructuring files towards the end, but my intent was to demonstrate that I can read a tutorial and look at code very quickly and create something.
            If I was writing in an existing codebase and/or given more time, I would have structured my files better and I would have researched
            how to split modules/controllers/components better as well. My code at the moment is all over the place.
